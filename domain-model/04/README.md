An embeddable type is another form of value type, and its lifecycle is bound to a parent entity type, therefore inheriting the attribute access(see Access strategies) from its parent


Embeddable types can be made up of basic values as well as associations, with the caveat that, when used as collection elements, they cannot define collections themselves.
